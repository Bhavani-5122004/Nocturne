                                NOCTURNE-Music Of The Stars

Nocturne is a music website made for users to explore a diverse category of music and find the one that fits their tastes. The structure of our website is as follows:

HOME/WELCOME PAGE:
    The first page to be opened is the home page, or welcome page, which will show a welcome button after loading. Once that button is clicked, it will take users to the rest of the website.

NOCTURNE PAGE:
    The next page is the true home of Nocturne, where we display our navbar as well as a side navbar that will be an indicator of which page the user is on. The NOCTURNE page has three categories-Top Artists, Top Albums and Top Songs. The artists and albums in the former two are clickable.

ARTISTS PAGE:
    The artists page displays six artists, all of whom are clickable and will take you to the albums page of that respective artist.

ALBUMS PAGE:
    The albums page of each artist displays six albums of each artist as well as the year they were released and the number of songs in them. Clicking any album will take the user to the songs page.

SONGS PAGE:
    The songs page of each album displays the album title, album image, artist title, year of release and number of songs, as well as each song in the album. It includes a play button that will take the user to a YouTube playlist or Spotify album playlist for that respective album.

ABOUT PAGE:
    The about page explains the purpose and use of NOCTURNE as a website along with the creators' information.

Throughout the website, there is a horizontal navigation bar at the top of the site with the logo and buttons for Home, Artists and About. There is also a vertical navigation bar at the side of each page as a page indicator, and also to provide an easy and simple way to switch between pages.
